        <h2>Targets:</h2>
        <p>I would like to get acquainted with the industry and 
          production programming particulary. I’m interesting how 
          communication really goes between developers inside a 
          particular project and also division of duties. All I can 
          propose is my desire and efforts which will be represented 
          by my score. In perspective I would like to become a full 
          stack developer, but I don’t build long-term plans especially 
          at this stage</p>

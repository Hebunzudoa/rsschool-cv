## Targets:  
I would like to get acquainted with the industry and production programming particulary. I’m interesting how communication really goes between developers inside a particular project and also division of duties. All I can propose is my desire and efforts which will be represented by my score. In perspective I would like to become a full stack developer, but I don’t build long-term plans especially at this stage  
## Skills:  
University c++ and java - very unsteady knowledge, that’s why I started from the beginning  
Git, vanilla javascript, html, css - all in progress  
## Code Expamples:  
All I have is in my account on github - https://github.com/Hebunzudoa  
## Experience:  
Same as previous point  
## Education:  
Incomplete higher education, BSU, RFiKT. Also interactive courses on htmlacademy / codecademy  
## English:  
Somewhere between A2-B1, I studied it at school and I was practiced in real life. This summary was written using google translate by the way
